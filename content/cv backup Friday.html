    </p>


        <p>I grew up in the Alps in southern Germany and discovered my love for filmmaking in my early 20s. A Eureka
          moment was cutting together shots from my parents’ camcorder and seeing how their juxtapostion
          created associations beyond the pictures. Hooked, but living far from anyone in the industry, I started making short films with friends and family.
          I read any book I could find and watched my favourite films without sound - to study the compositions and angles in the flow of the edit. </p>

          <p>After a detour into a more 'traditional' education,
        studying Computer Science, I realised my heart was in filmmaking. I went to study Cinematography in London at the National Film and Television School
      under the mentorship of Brian Tufano BSC, whose focus on story and imagination was a huge inspiration. Since graduating in 2009 I have been
      working as a cinematographer on feature films, television and commercials. </p>

    <p>Each script is a new journey for me. The words resonate and spark curiosity. Sometimes asking questions is more
      valuable than looking for answers, sometimes the first steps are crystal clear. </p>

<p>I love the conversation with the director and creative team to be open-minded, fearless and honest.
Plenty will come from within the story and characters. In my mind the essence of the script and
the director’s vision are in dialogue with the places, the actors, cultural references, and our personal and filmmaking history. </p>

<p>I am looking for a visual approach with substance and integrity, whether it has been
carefully mapped out, or instinctively captures the moment.
During filming the camera unifies everything we have discovered with the
indelible truth only this moment in time provides. The images will be
refracted into new meanings in the audiences’ minds. Light,
textures, colour, rhythm - portraiture and atmosphere - all communicate and carry the
potential to touch us.</p>
