    </p>

    <p>I see each project as a new journey - to understand the story it tells,
      the people it portrays, the world it depicts and the human experience it
      communicates. Each story allows us to explore and reconfigure the elements
      of visual storytelling, finding the artistic approach to express the director’s vision.</p>

      <p>The conversations with the creative team are sometimes associative and
        conceptual, other times we examine a single moment in the script. I always like to be
        open minded, fearless and honest in these conversations. Trusting the story and the
        characters guides us. Our ideas are informed by the places we
        scout, cultural influences and our personal experiences.</p>

      <p>I look for a visual approach with integrity and substance.
        Whether we mapped it out before, or we instinctively capture the
        moment during the scene, the approach is never arbitrary.
        The camera fuses what we have discovered along the way with the truth of the
        performances in this specific moment in time.  The images will be refracted
        in the audiences’ minds, taking on new meanings. Light, texture, colour,
        contrast and rhythm - portraiture and atmosphere -  all carry the potential
        to resonate and create an experience of some insight into life.</p>
