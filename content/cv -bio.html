    </p>

    <p>I grew up in the a rural alpine area in southern Germany. I discovered my love for filmmaking in my early 20s,
      a eureka moment was cutting together various shots taken with my parents’ camcorder and seeing how their juxtapostion
      created associations beyond the pictures. Hooked on the creative possibilites of filmmaking, but living far from anyone
      working in the industry, I started making shortfilms with friends and family. I was self taught at the time, reading any
      book I could find and watching my favourite films without sound - to study the shots, compositions and angles in the flow of the edit.</p>

<p>After embarking on a more ‘traditional’ education for a while, studying Computer Science, I realized my heart was in visual storytelling and decided to focus on filmmaking. I went to study at
the National Film and Television School in the UK, under the mentorship of Brian Tufano BSC, whose open minded and
fearless approach to storytelling was a huge inspiration. Other classes that influenced me a lot where
taught by Stuart Harris, Sean Bobbit BSC and Roger Deakins BSC.  </p>

<p>In 2012 I photographed the low budget TV Drama MY MURDER, based on the the tragic murder of Shakilus Townsend. The project was directed
by acclaimed documentary filmmaker Bruce Goodison, the visual approach was to be authentic but expressionistic.
Winning awards and critical acclaim the project created more opportunities for me to work on Feature Films and TV Drama
in the UK and internationally.</p>

<p>I have been building creative partnerships with a variety of collaborators, like the directors Julian Jarrold, Pete Travis
and Bruce Goodison. My first projects with Pete Travis were the cold war spy thriller LEGACY (2013), which was nominated
for the BSC Award for Best Cinematography in a TV Drama, followed by THE GO-BETWEEN (2015), an evocative adaptation of the
novel by JP Hartley, which won the BSC Award for Best Cinematography in a TV Drama. </p>

<p>Recent credits include CITY OF TINY LIGHTS (Dir. Pete Travis) a neon lit neo noir thriller set in London,
the suspenseful THE WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION (Dir: Julian Jarrold, Nominated for BSC Award for Best Cinematography in a TV Drama)
and SULPHUR AND WHITE (Dir. Julian Jarrold), an unflinching abuse drama.
Last year I photographed the Netflix Original Drama BEHIND HER EYES (Dir. Erik Richter Strand),
a psychological thriller based on the bestselling novel by Sara Pinborough.
